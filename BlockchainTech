Solves double spending problem! using (proof of work)

The blockchain’s innovation is decentralized consensus. If your app needs some feature that requires everyone else 
to agree on something, you should use a blockchain. A simple example is a username system for which it doesn’t really matter
who has the “@user” username; what matters is that everyone agrees who has it. There have been lots of decentralized protocols
in the past, but they all required nodes to trust one another. The blockchain is an immutable record that every node has
a copy of, so no one can pretend that they too are @user. This can be done via the use of smart contracts.

Smart contracts

A smart contract is a piece of code that lives in a blockchain. When a preprogrammed condition is triggered, the smart
contract executes the corresponding contractual clause.
